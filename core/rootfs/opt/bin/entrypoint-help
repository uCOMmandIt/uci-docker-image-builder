--------- ENTRYPOINT HELP ----------
entrypoint commands are shell, maphostid, help, image, script and a custom command (start, by default)
otherwise you can pass any shell command such as 'ls -la'

----- Custom Command (start) -------------

the current container custom command is > ${ENTRYPOINT_CMD:-start}
and the script/binary that command runs is ${ENTRYPOINT_CMD_PATH:-$BIN_DIR/start}

you can replace this start script with your own or any binary
placed at init/opt/bin/start in your build source directory
or set the  \$ENTRYPOINT_CMD_PATH and (optionally) the \$ENTRYPOINT_CMD variables

---------- script ---------------
you can pipe a script from the host to container with this command

script  < test.sh

if you use a heredoc you can delay variable substition 
until the command is run in container.

script  << "SCRIPT"
echo $BIN_DIR
SCRIPT

----- Overwrite Entrypoint
It is also possible to completely override the container entrypoint with your own
$BIN_DIR/entrypoint script but is not recommmended as then a bash login shell is
assured (unless you see to it) and thus critical runtime environment variables 
will not be set
